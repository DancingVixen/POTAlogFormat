# POTAlogFormat
Takes user inputs and automatically generates the POTA ADIF format

NOTE: I DID NOT MAKE THIS. I comissioned this from a python dev which can be found here: https://sysceen-portfolio.mdbgo.io/

im just putting this on the hub since i know i will lose the file

## why

idk if its just me but it takes me like 5 minutes to properly name a file due to having to look it over 29384902384 times to make sure I have the correct information in the correct places. This asks for Callsign, Park, Date and will auto-fill. 

This is made for USA PARKS. It will automatically prefix with "K-" so you only need the numerical park identifier. Small modification can make this work for any country.
